        Kitesurfing in Carqueiranne<br>and then hobbling, sniffling, and hitchhiking my way back

        At one point before we were dating I told Albert I would like to visit France soon and Albert told me he would love to show me around. We started talking dates and he said maybe I could join him for the weekend after a good friend’s wedding that was happening in May. I’d never been invited to a wedding before so I decided to invite myself. Albert immediately brought up some points that could make this difficult: he’d already told the bride and groom that he was coming alone, we would have to pretend we were together, and his ex was going to be there as well.

        In the end we decided that I would stay in the city of Carqueiranne while Albert attended the wedding on Saturday.

        I had recently discovered the pleasures of surfing, and I was determined to surf whenever and wherever I could. So I googled “surf carqueiranne” and found this place called <a href="http://www.kitesurf-passion.com/" target="_blank">Kitesurf Passion</a>. I had encountered kitesurfers once before, when Easyjet unexpectedly landed in Porto Santo instead of Madeira during a weekend trip to Portugal, and we were desperate to make up for the lost day while waiting for the ferry ride to the correct island. The kitesurf instructor on Porto Santo had told us, then, that we would have to practice out of the water for the first 9 hours of instruction before we could enter the ocean with a kite. So I was anxious about Kitesurf Passion and made Albert call them to make sure they offered other things, like stand-up paddleboarding, for backup. If I was to be on my own while Albert was at a wedding, I at least wanted to be in the water.

        <a href="http://www.seatemperature.org/europe/france/carqueiranne-may.htm" target="_blank">seatemperature.org</a> said that the temperature of the sea would be around 16°C when I planned to visit. Newquay had been 16°C at the end of October 2015 when I surfed with a 3-2 wetsuit (3mm in the torso, 2mm in the limbs). So I decided to take my own 3-2 wetsuit, so that I could avoid renting a wetsuit that many others have peed in. I was squeamish about such things. I had a thicker wetsuit that I’d worn to Bundoran, Ireland in March when the <a href="http://www.seatemperature.org/europe/ireland/bundoran-march.htm" target="_blank">water was around 8°C</a>; but I figured a 3-2 would be more than enough for kitesurfing in Carqueiranne.

        Albert drove me to the spot from our airbnb and we had a moment of anxiety when we couldn’t locate Kitesurf Passion past the lesson time. Albert speed-walked around in his smart indigo suit, head a-swiveling, arms a-swinging, looking rather dapper, while I spotted a van full of what looked like sea-going equipment and ran over as fast as I could. I waved to Albert. He nodded uncertainly, and I disappeared into the restroom to change into my bikini and wetsuit.

        Since I was the only kitesurfing noob in the group, and also the only person who couldn’t speak French, I was singled out and had a very nice private 3-hour lesson. The instructor was brilliant. In the span of a couple hours, he’d taught me to steer the kite in figure-eights so that I could use the power of the wind to pull both of us (he was holding onto a handle on the back of my kitesurfing belt thing), and also to resurrect a fallen kite off of the water so that I could resume the exciting figure-eights. After 2 hours in the water with the kite, my (amazing) instructor told me that it was time to get the board. As eager as I was to finally level up and unlock the Board, I had to call it quits. I was so cold I could barely talk - my teeth had gone past chattering, and my jaw was clenched so tight I could only speak like a ventriloquist. The 3-2 wetsuit had most <i>definitely</i> not been enough.

        Two key differences made surfing in Newquay in a 3-2 perfectly fine, but kitesurfing in Carqueiranne with the same wetsuit unbearably cold. First, surfing involves a lot of cardio. You need to paddle to get out past the whitewash, paddle around to follow the breaks, put in a burst of paddling to catch that wave, pop up, and then squat all the way to the shore (it is a glorified, well-timed burpee). Kitesurfing is not much cardio. Second, you stay mostly on top of your board when you’re surfing. Your body is above the water more often than not. As a kitesurf noob, I didn’t even <i>have</i> a board with me. I was submerged in the ocean, up to my neck, and sometimes, unfortunately, up to my head. That made a lot of difference.

        My instructor seemed disappointed when I told him I was too cold to continue. He asked if I was sure, and I said yes, filled with guilt and shame. But soon I was too cold to care. I peeled off my wetsuit, hugged myself tightly in a borrowed snuggie, and shivered uncontrollably while the boat went around collecting kitesurfers and their kites. With each additional kitesurfer on board, I got bumped further down towards the nose of the boat. It was a very windy day, and the boat bounced heavily. On one such bounce, I landed and had that “Oh <i>fuck</i>” feeling and knew that my back was not going to be the same for the next few days.

        After saying goodbyes and trying to pretend I wasn’t as destroyed as I was feeling, I beelined to a crepe shop and ordered a savory crepe and a sweet crepe (a two-course crepe meal!) with the point and smile method.

        Then I found that I missed the last bus back to the airbnb.

        “This is fine,” I told myself. I actually said it out loud, to see if it would be more convincing if I heard the words. (It was not.) To perpetuate the desired tranquil state of mind, I decided to take a casual stroll and pick a nice bar to hang out by myself, and maybe read the emergency book I carried around for this type of purpose. I located what seemed like a lively downtown area (relatively speaking; Carqueiranne is no London) and after suspiciously loitering around for a good half hour, made my pick and walked upto the bar. The bartender said something in French, I said something in English, and we both stared at each other for a bit. I unsuccessfully tried speaking Spanish (“Vino, por favor!”), then made a failed attempt to mime a wine glass. He made the universal index finger gesture that meant “wait a sec” and called out to a group of people who could have been co-owners or squatters of the bar, I could not tell. Eventually the combination of a very unhelpful but eager “English speaking” lady and google translate helped me get my glass of wine, which turned out to be a single euro! After some book-reading, side-eyeing a sleeping gentleman who was being pranked by his co-owner/squatter friends, I decided I should try getting back to the airbnb.

        Unfortunately, Plan B did not work out. Taxis did not run. I wondered I should call Albert and see if he could leave the wedding to drive me, but that felt like giving up. I looked up google maps and saw that if I walked, it would take 2.5 hours. It seemed doable.

        What I did not anticipate was the stretch of windy forest road I would have to go through. I reached the edge of the forest just as dusk faded into darkness. I went forward into the forest, and it was really, really, really dark. I retraced my steps back to the last source of light before the forest began - some kind of farmhouse. I cried a little bit. And then I called Albert. He didn’t pick up. I cried a little more, feeling a bit energized by anger. And decided I would walk through the forest. It was just darkness, it wasn’t anything frightening.

        After walking for 2 minutes in total darkness save for the sudden flashes of headlight from passing cars, I decided this was not going to work out. I had to hitchhike. I had never hitchhiked in my life, ever. I saw a glimpse of headlight at the beginning of the forest, and hesitantly raised my thumb. The beamers flooded my sight and I thought the car was going to pass by, but it stopped. The woman in the driver’s seat pushed open the passenger door and spoke very fast in French. I stammered out some words, pointed at the map I had screenshotted on my phone. She gestured that I should get in first, so I did.

        She was a literature teacher and windsurf instructor in the area and was on her way to pick her teenage daughter up from Hyeres (pronounced YEGH, rhymes with “ugh,” but not the version of ugh that is pronounced like Ugg) and that was in the opposite direction of where I was trying to get to, but she would drive me anyway because these woods were <i>dangerous</i> and there were - what’s the word? At this point she squashed her nose and made snoring sounds. “Pigs?” I offered, and she nodded enthusiastically.
    </p>

    <p class="post-paragraph">
        We picked up her daughter and then drove over to La Crau, and I made the 20-minute walk over to the airbnb while talking to Albert on the phone. I told him all about my day, feeling a bit comforted by the celebratory wedding noises in the background from his side of the call. Going into technical detail about how to control the kite made me forget that the road was dark and deserted. When I finally arrived, I was too relieved to feel happy. I took the most unsatisfying shower of my life in the cramped italitan shower that only managed a sad, lukewarm drizzle. Then I wrapped a towel around my wet hair and dropped dead on the bed, hoping I would be able to wake up when Albert came back from the wedding to let him inside, pretending that the blanket I was hugging was his warm pupper butt.
