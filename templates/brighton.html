        Tailing Albert to Brighton:<br>a tale of sore butts, lust, and 4 flat tires
    </h1>

    <p class="post-paragraph">
        The last time I had ridden my beautiful fixie before the Brighton weekend was in 2013, when I was briefly experimenting with a bicycle-train-walk hybrid commute from Mountain View to San Francisco. One evening I got off the train after a long day, unlocked my bike from the rack, and hopped on. I realized the brakes were no longer working at (or rather, while speeding past) the first stop sign. Further inspection revealed that someone had intentionally cut my brake cables. No matter how much I puzzled over it, I couldn’t think of a way for a perfectly solid metal cable to accidentally end up with a surgical incision.

        From 2013 to 2015, I let my then-boyfriend-and-roommate use my bike, since he had no qualms riding a bike without brakes (he argued that it <i>did</i> have brakes, it was a fixie after all - you just had to fight the pedals to slow down). Besides, his workplace was 0.9 miles from home (just enough to qualify for the living-close-to-work rent subsidy) so he wouldn’t be covering much distance anyway.

        When I moved to London, my company offered to ship a big shipping-container-full of stuff to my new place. I fitted my bike with a rear brake, flipped over the rear wheel so it was no longer a fixie, and sent it over. But from October 2015 to February 2016 it lay neglected in my back yard until Albert came over to fix it up for our big trip. We (read: he) fitted front and back fenders and plumped my wheels while we (read: I) watched three epidoes of House of Cards projected onto the wall. Albert was most concerned about how my single-speed bike would climb hills we would encounter, if any. I was most concerned about <a href="https://reductress.com/post/5-bottoms-that-still-wont-make-it-easy-to-put-your-vagina-on-a-bicycle/" target="_blank">being violated by the bike seat</a> and tacked on a gel seatpad.

        We woke up early on Saturday morning and headed out. I had never biked through London traffic before, and throughout the turns and twists and signals and filtering, I kept my eyes glued to Albert’s butt and tailed him very closely behind.

        When we were out of London, we strapped a bluetooth speaker to the back of Albert’s bike and connected it to my phone. This bluetooth link turned into an invisible leash that would let Albert know when I was falling behind, because the music would start breaking up. (Mildly interesting: it only worked when Albert was in front, because if I were in front instead, my body would swallow the bluetooth signal and block it entirely. Turns out, outside of the city, without the cars and buildings for the signal to bounce off of, you need to keep the space between the device and speaker clear of any signal-absorbing things).

        Muddy, unpaved roads were my biggest enemy. I’d only ever ridden my bike on paved and gloriously straight Californian roads and learned quickly that 28mm road bike tires with barely any tread were not well suited for gravelly, muddy country roads.

        We took a quick standing snack break when we passed Gatwick, the halfway point. We counted maybe five or six planes pass above our heads while I realized granola raspberry cookies were in fact the most delicious food in the world.

        Hills were mostly okay. Though what would’ve been 90% cardio turned into 90% strength training when I climbed brief inclines; each pedal forward up a hill on my single-speed felt like a <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pistol-perfect-one-legged-squats-and-beyond.html" target="_blank">pistol squat</a>. Albert pushed me sometimes when he saw that I was struggling. I could hear his breathing go from steady to quick panting in the span of 5 seconds while I enjoyed the fruits of his labor. At some point he started pushing my butt instead of my back, and I decided it was okay (we were just friends) because the boost was more substantial when applied closer to the center of mass (the butt).

        I <i>did</i> hate everything for a bit - the hill, the cars zipping past, Albert (who broke free of the bluetooth leash and climbed far, far ahead), my sorry life choices - during this segment of the trip through <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/5596541" target="_blank">Devil’s Dyke</a>:

        The rest of the way was mostly downhill. Our butts were sore where the bottom of the hip bone ground on the bike seat. I did some research and learned that the bone is called <i>ischium</i>, also commonly referred to as the “sit bone” by yoga teachers trying to tell you that you’re doing yoga wrong.

        And then, we finally arrived.
