        Tailing Albert to Brighton:<br>a tale of sore butts, lust, and 4 flat tires

    <p class="post-paragraph">
        The last time I had ridden my beautiful fixie before the Brighton weekend was in 2013, when I was briefly experimenting with a bicycle-train-walk hybrid commute from Mountain View to San Francisco. One evening I got off the train after a long day, unlocked my bike from the rack, and hopped on. I realized the brakes were no longer working at (or rather, while speeding past) the first stop sign. Further inspection revealed that someone had intentionally cut my brake cables. No matter how much I puzzled over it, I couldn’t think of a way for a perfectly solid metal cable to accidentally end up with a surgical incision.
