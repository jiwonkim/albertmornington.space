        The sub-zero cold of a Korean January was forcing us to stay indoors as much as we could. This was in part because my jacket was a shit jacket only made for letting others know you shop from Urban Outfitters. Dubbed <i>UNIF X UO Duvet Blanket Coat</i>, it was supposed to give the impression that you were bundled up in a cozy blanket, but in fact it lacked the core features of a functional jacket: insulation, zippers that actually zip up the front to prevent the cold from seeping in, and pockets placed at logical locations so that your hands can find them no later than immediately.

    But four days mostly indoors and we were getting cabin fever. After reading some blog posts that assured us hiking Bukhansan in January is something people do for fun, we planned our route and woke up early Wednesday morning, which placed us smack in the middle of rush hour. We got to see some real people heading to real jobs (as opposed to fake people like us on holiday) and found ourselves some Korean picnic food after a harrowing choice between two rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbap" target="_blank">kimbap</a> places.

        Luckily for us, we were heading to the edges of Seoul, against the rush hour crowd, so our ride to Bukhansan-sung Entrance was traffic-free. Not so luckliy for us, the weather forecast had changed overnight; instead of the smiling sun, we were now looking at haze. Later on we discovered that this meant no spectacular views of Seoul for us - even at the summit! On the flipside, the trail was basically empty, and it felt like we had the entire mountain to ourselves.

        We opted for the route that took us to the summit (Baekundae Peak, 836m) the fastest. This meant a lot of abrupt elevation gain, and our layers shed one by one until both our backpacks were bursting at the seams. We had to sacrifice a bag of potato chips (a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pokachip/" target="_blank">Poka Chip</a>) and punch another one into submission to make room. Somehow both sweating and freezing, we made it to what I mistakenly thought was the summit before seeing the sign that pointed to the rocky outcrop that you were supposed to climb to get to the real peak. That last 0.3 km legit terrified me. It started to snow, and the rocks were slippery, and the wind was making my shit jacket catch sail. If I annoyed Albert by repeating “I’m scared!” he hid it very well.

        The best part of the hike was when we stumbled upon a <i>sanjang</i> and had our well-deserved lunch. We bought an instant ramen bowl for 2,000₩ (~$2) which came with a small plate of kimchi. We had two different kinds of kimbap: tuna mayo and spicy pork. They were quite excellent with ramen and kimchi.

        We had originally planned to take a certain route down the mountain, which involved meandering alon the old castle walls. But we somehow missed the fork in the trail and ended up coming straight down, hours ahead of schedule. We were supposed to meet up with my friends for dinner, but since we had some time on our hands, I took Albert to see my old middle school. It was winter vacation, so I wasn’t sure if we’d be able to get in.

        I used to live in a very hilly neighborhood, and my school commute was 20-minutes of hiking every day. To get around this, my best friend and I had scouted a route that involved sneaking into multi-story parking lot elevators (that techinically forbade such usage) and multi-story shopping mall elevators (also forbidden) so that we could optimize our potential energy gain without breaking a sweat first thing in the morning.

    <p class="post-paragraph">
        I took Albert through the same commute. And the hill-loving pupper that he is, Albert absolutely loved it. (It also could have something to do with the nice lady who held the elevator doors open for us and proceeded to tell me that Albert was very handsome and I should marry him)
